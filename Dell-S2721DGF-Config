I got mine 2 days ago. I'm not a reviewer and don't really have tools for testing this monitor, but it looks great. Refresh rate is 165 as advertised (looked at ufo test and it looks really smooth) I have read that if you want it at 1ms response time you might be able to notice some ghosting effects or bluriness. So I guess the best option is to put it on 3-5 ms response time since clearer gameplay might be better than a few ms.

The monitor starts with the standard preset and I think it's pretty cool, but the colors might be a bit too saturated, or idk. I have used these settings from someone who calibrated their monitor:

Preset mode: custom color

Gain: R=81 G=84 B=94

Bightness = 35% (I used like 70-80% because it's too dim for me especially in the day)

Contrast = 79%

With these settings the colors seem pretty natural to me and I really like it. But you can choose the other presets too if you like them more. Personally this is the best result for me.

The joystick on the back for the OSD is really neat. A lot easyer to navigate and you don't need to remember what all the buttons do. Many usb ports, 1 DP 2 HDMI, good stuff. (audio jack but no speakers)

I played LoL a lot and Apex these days. Everything looks really good and the 165hz is noticeable after playing on a 7 yr old 60hz Asus monitor.

If you have any other questions, don't hesitate to ask. Btw, don't forget to put your settings from nvidia control panel to 165hz and to be enabled on desktop too, not only in games.
