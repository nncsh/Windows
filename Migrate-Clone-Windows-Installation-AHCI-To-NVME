The usual problem, whether you're migrating from IDE to AHCI or from AHCI to NVMe, is that the drivers are not configured to start on boot – they must be already present very early during the boot process, before the normal "device detection" system has been started. By default, Windows only boot-starts those drivers which were needed at installation time – the rest are still on the system but only get started "on demand" in a later phase.

The generic Microsoft NVMe driver seems to be called stornvme. (For comparison, the generic SATA AHCI driver is storahci, though Intel RST has a different name.) You can change its configuration using sc from an administrator Command Prompt:

sc config stornvme start= boot
sc query stornvme
sc qc stornvme

TL;DR
- BEFORE YOU CLONEZILLA (or whatever app)
- On the soure OS:
- Disable fast startup (might not be needed but to be sure this takes)
- Admin command prompt
    sc config stornvme start= boot
- Shut down and immediately clone. Do not reboot the source machine as Windows may disable stornvme again.
